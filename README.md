vim-config
==========

Vim configuration files: vimrc, plugins, syntax enhacements etc.

For now I have several alternatives to browse files. I'll probably stick with
one of them when the new usage patterns settle in. 

To browse the filesystem:
 - Winmanager + FileExplorer (CTRL-w CTRL-t)
 - NERDTree (CTRL-w CTRL-e)
 - CtrlP (CTRL-p)

To browse the open buffers:
 - Winmanager + BufExplorer (CTRL-w CTRL-b once WM is open)
 - CtrlP (CTRL-p CTRL-f)

To browse the tags:
 - Winmanager + Taglist (CTRL-n on the main WM window once WM is open)
 - Tagbar

Solid plugins I feel I'll be using for a long time:
 - Fugitive
 - Powerline
 - Syntastic
 - Easytags
 - NERDcommenter

Stuff I might or might not use:
 - Ack
 - pydoc
 - Snipmate
